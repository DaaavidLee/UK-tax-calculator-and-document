# 1: The best bit #
The best part of my assignment is undoubtedly the Design.java. Not only is it 
the only coding part, but it also contains all of the concepts I've learnt from 
the lectures, labs, and tutorials. 

The part I would like to improve probably is acknowledgement.md. Since lectures are not 
the only place where I study Java, it's hard for me to cite everything I've learnt concisely 
from lecture notes. Therefore, I cited some of them from the webpages in which I didn't learn 
from at first place.

# 2: Favourite mistake # 
My favourite mistake is writing the entire code line by line based on the 
Codegolf description without having a complete understanding beforehand. 
Instead, I should do the abstraction first by utilising pseudo code or flowcharts to enhance my 
comprehension of the project. 

First, I created a bunch of magic numbers such as "37700" and "99730."
Second, I encountered the error of naming local variables several times.
Third, I created too many useless nested-if conditionals. By thinking the
outline of the code beforehand, I could have avoided all mistakes mentioned
above.


# 3: Helping previous you #
1. Write down the pseudo code or flowchart before delving into the coding 
part, so that I would have a grand understanding of the project and avoid 
redoing the coding part several times. By doing so, I could save a considerable 
amount of time for debugging and rewriting codes. Therefore, this piece of advice
ranks the first place.
2. No need to read all the instructions at once.
   The instructor's guidance is detailed but well-structured,
   allowing me to follow along step by step without needing to absorb
   every detail beforehand. Likewise, applying this method could have saved
   me a lot of time, but no extra work would generate if I read the guidance at once,
   so it ranks second.
3. Understand the timing of using global or local variable. Thanks to IDE, this kind
of error could be spotted immediately, but it would still be more handy if I 
could remember the difference and save the time for correcting. Due to the time
wasted on it is not comparable to the other two, it ranks third.

# 4: Helping future you #
If I were part of a team in a company that provides financial services, 
developing a new app which aims to streamline the process of managing clients'
financial portfolios, I would be benefit from this assignment as...
1. Markdown ensures consistency in documentation and enables collaborative editing through version-controll 
system like Github. 
2. Testing the accessibility during the development of the app guarantees that 
the product is usable by individuals with different needs. 
3. Regularly reviewing engineering requirements ensures that the project 
remains aligned with business goals and user needs.


# 5: You be the judge #
1. Guidance reading, 3/5. 
    * I could be more efficient of reading the guidance
   if applying the reading skill on it.
2. Worksheet, 4/5. 
   * Clear instruction and learning goals. If I were the target
   audience. 
3. Design code, 2/5.
    * There must be a shorter and more efficient way to 
   reach the same function, but I could only code around 50 lines
   based on my basic knowledge of Java programming.
    * Although it would not be noticed based on my final project,
   I made some mistakes that lower my efficiency when designing my
   code.
4. Reflective writing, 5/5
   * I am good at observing and reflecting. Also, I have
   paid attention to these reflective questions whilst writing 
   my code, because I've read the whole guidance before delving
   into this project.
